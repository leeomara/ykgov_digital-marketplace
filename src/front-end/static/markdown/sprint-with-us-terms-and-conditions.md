## 1.11. Subcontractors

- a) Unless the RFP states otherwise, the Province will accept Proposals where more than one organization or individual is proposed to deliver the services described in the RFP, so long as the Proposal identifies the lead entity that will be the Proponent and that will have sole responsibility to deliver the services under the Contract.

By submitting a Proposal, the Proponent represents that it is not aware of any circumstances that would give rise to a conflict of interest that is actual or potential, in respect of the RFP.

## 1.16. Limitation of Damages

By submitting a Proposal, the Proponent agrees that it will not claim damages, for whatever reason, relating to the Contract or in respect of the competitive process, in excess of an amount equivalent to the reasonable costs incurred by the Proponent in preparing its Proposal and the Proponent, by submitting a Proposal waives any other claims whether arising in contract (including loss profit claims), tort or otherwise, including based on a breach of "Contract A" or other tendering law duties or obligations.

The Province reserves the right in its sole discretion to:

- a) disqualify a Proposal if the Province is not satisfied that the Proponent is clearly identified;
