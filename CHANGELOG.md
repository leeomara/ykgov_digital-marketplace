# Changelog

## Documentation

This document summarizes the various changes made to the Digital Marketplace web application. Generally, only core maintainers of this project should be adding entries to this Changelog.

### Versioning

The project is versioned using the following format:

```
MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION
```

`MAJOR_VERSION` is a natural number indicating major releases with new functionality and, optionally, modifications to existing functionality.

`MINOR_VERSION` is a natural number indicating a release that **only** includes trivial modifications to existing functionality (e.g. bugfixes, performance improvements, etc). Signficant changes to existing functionality and new features must be released under a new `MAJOR_VERSION` number.

### Log Format

Each log must follow the formatting guidelines described here. You can use the template provided below for logging changes to this document.

Note that each log must include a version number that has either an incremented major or minor version. New log items must be added to the beginning of the list below.
