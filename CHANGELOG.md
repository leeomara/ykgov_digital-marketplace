## Documentation

This document summarizes the various changes made to the Digital Marketplace web application. Generally, only core maintainers of this project should be adding entries to this Changelog.

### Versioning

The project is versioned using the following format:

```
MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION

MAJOR_VERSION is a natural number indicating major releases with new functionality and, optionally, modifications to existing functionality.

MINOR_VERSION is a natural number indicating a release that **only** includes trivial modifications to existing functionality (e.g. bugfixes, performance improvements, etc). Signficant changes to existing functionality and new features must released under a new MAJOR_VERSION number.
```
